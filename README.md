Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, focusing on the absolute environmental sustainability assessment of hydrogen production systems. My work covers the process engineering of production technologies and computational life cycle assessment. I typically code in Python, MATLAB, and Julia.
